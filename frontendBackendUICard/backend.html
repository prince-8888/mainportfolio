                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">Node.js</strong>: <br>
                    Node.js is a powerful, open-source, server-side runtime environment built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling them to build scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it well-suited for handling real-time applications and heavy I/O operations, such as chat apps and streaming services.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">Express.js</strong>:  <br>
                    Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework built on top of Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs by providing a set of robust features for routing, middleware, and request handling. Express.js is lightweight and unopinionated, making it highly customizable and suitable for developing single-page applications, RESTful APIs, and full-stack web applications.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card"> MongoDB</strong>:  <br>
                    MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is a document-oriented database, meaning it organizes data as collections of documents rather than rows and tables, as in traditional relational databases. This structure allows for more flexible data models, making it easier to scale and adapt to changes in application requirements. MongoDB is highly scalable, supports high availability through replication, and can handle large volumes of unstructured data efficiently.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">SQL (Structured Query Language)</strong>: <br>
                    SQL is a standard language used to communicate with and manage relational databases. Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns, ensuring data integrity and supporting complex relationships between data points. SQL is powerful for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data and is used in popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. Unlike NoSQL databases like MongoDB, SQL databases enforce a strict schema, making them suitable for applications where data consistency and structured relationships are important.</li>
