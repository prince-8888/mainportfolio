                This card showcases essential frontend technologies that are used for building modern and interactive web interfaces:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong>: <br>
                    HTML is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages. It acts as the skeleton of a web page, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It ensures that content is properly organized and accessible by web browsers.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong>:  <br>
                    CSS is used to style and layout web pages, allowing developers to control the appearance of text, colors, spacing, and overall visual design. It makes web pages more attractive and user-friendly, enabling responsive design for better viewing on different screen sizes.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">Bootstrap</strong>:  <br>
                    Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework that helps developers build responsive, mobile-first websites quickly. It includes pre-designed components, such as navigation bars, buttons, forms, and modals, making it easier to develop consistent and functional UIs with less code.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">React</strong>: <br>
                    React is a powerful JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It utilizes a component-based architecture, enabling developers to create reusable UI components. Reactâ€™s virtual DOM ensures efficient rendering, making applications more performant and interactive.</li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong class="headings-inside-frontend-card">Tailwind CSS</strong>: <br>
                    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to create custom designs by applying pre-defined classes directly in the HTML. It streamlines the development process by providing granular control over styles without having to write custom CSS. Tailwindâ€™s approach promotes rapid prototyping and easy customization, resulting in a more efficient workflow.</li>
